	<h2>About the book</h2>

<p>GITT follows the lives of some developers at a fictional company called Tamagoyaki Inc.
They are a small software outfit who write bespoke software for people.
It may be that you work for a company that is very similar to Tamagoyaki Inc and you are looking to implement a version control system for your own company, or it could be that you have been using a version control for a long time and are looking for a helping hand in applying the Git system to your needs.
Regardless of which box you fit into, GITT should provide you with some useful knowledge in a way that is designed to help you remember the scenarios and their associated solutions.</p>

<p>The book will follow the lead developer John, as he works to bring the company into line by implementing a version control system.
It's not something he's ever really used in earnest and he feels a little out of his depth.
It is hoped that your confidence and knowledge about both version control systems, and Git in particular, will grow whilst reading GITT.</p>

<p>The chapters are presented as weeks during the implementation of Tamagoyaki Inc's version control system project.
Each chapter spells a new week in the project and you will follow the life of John and his colleagues as they solve problems and learn tricks of the Git trade.
As well as presenting and solving common issues, the book will also be littered with breakout boxes, intended to tell you exactly what is happening inside Git at each stage.
This is intended to further your knowledge and understanding of this powerful piece of software.
At the end of each chapter are "John's Notes" which should build into a quick reference guide.</p>

<p>After each week, there is also the opportunity for you to delve further into the guts of what has been presented during the week with the <span id="highlight">After Hours</span> sections.
These sections will take the knowledge that you have learned during the week and take it to a much deeper level, often showing diagrammatic ways of how commits take place, or even looking at the contents of files within the repository file structure itself.
These chapters are not meant to scare you, but are presented in the hope that you can reinforce what you have learned through the week by reading through more complex material.</p>

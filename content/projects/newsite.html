<p>I decided a while back that I would try to build a new website. I've built many over the years, ranging from simple one pagers, to more complex <span id="highlight">dynamic</span> sites with database backends. This time, however, I wanted to try something new. I'd heard a lot of buzz on the Internet about <span id="highlight">static site generators</span> and decided to give them a try.</p>
<p>As of right now, this site is still in development. It is being developed in <span id="highlight">nanoc</span> and uses the awesome <span id="hightlight">Zurb</span> for layout. Yes btw, those should be links. There's an example of how not finished this site is :)</p>
